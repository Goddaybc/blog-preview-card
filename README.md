## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```
<div class='container'>
<div class='content'>
</div>
</div>
```

```
.content_text__h3 {
  background-color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
  border-radius: 5%;
  display: inline;
  padding: 5px 20px !important;
  font-size: min(1.2rem, 3.5vw);
  line-height: 4.5%;
}
.content {
  background-color: #fff;
  border-radius: 5%;
  width: min(100%, 375px);
  /* margin: 0 auto; */
  padding: 1rem;
  border: 2px solid #000;

  /* position: absolute;
  left: 50%;
  top: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%); */
}
This place was quite tough for me i had to use chatgpt a lot to get it done

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

Areas i want to focus on is CSS FLEX, FLEXBOX, and GRID. These are giving me headache
